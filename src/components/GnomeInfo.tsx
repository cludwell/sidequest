            A gnome's energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch
            of his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall
            and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually
            adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and
            their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a
            tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the
            gnome's insatiable interest in everything around.

            and they squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out of their three to five
            centuries of life. Humans might wonder about getting bored over the
            course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savor
            the beauties of the world in their long years, but gnomes seem to

            inventors. They're willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves
            in the process of perfecting what they do, taking bold (sometimes

                interesting hobbies were just a few of the countless chores that
                rock gnomes burdened each day with. Much like a child, a rock
                gnome possessed very little tolerance for long term mental focus

                Rock gnomes gathered in small towns, rarely reaching 500 adults.
                They considered large cities to be uncomfortable, partially
                because of the great amount of demand the Big Folk had for their
                skills. Rock gnomes were comfortable deep underground almost as
                much as on the surface world, possessing skill in ore and
                gemcutting that surpassed that of the dwarves, along with
                notable skills in toymaking and clockwork engineering. Rock
                gnomes were also the finest producers of the unusual weapons
                known as "guns."

                slept together in a single room. Rock gnome burrows were
                constructed by clan, allowing underground tunnels to conjoin one
                another for defense and other purposes.

                cautious when contacting other races, and eyed all strangers
                with suspicion.

                Sullen and hard-working, deep gnomes were wholly dedicated to
                any task to which they set themselves, typically mining for
                males and housekeeping for females. Although outsiders found
                deep gnomes' overly serious attitude made for sour company,
                those qualities made the svirfneblin tireless pursuers of
                excellence in their metalworking and weapon forging. These
                attitudes were also justified in part by the harsh environs the
                deep gnomes inhabited, which required a degree of stoicism and
                quiet suffering in order to serve the greater good. Any sounds
                or raised voices could attract danger to deep gnome homes and
                fire was used sparingly for cooking and warmth. Their
                seriousness and pessimism only faded when admiring the gems
                which fascinated them so much.

                nonetheless exhibited the same insatiable curiosity and
                craftiness when put in the right circumstances. It was this
                trait, more than any other, which led some deep gnomes to
                abandon their cautious upbringing and explore the world around
                them. Some of these wandering deep gnomes turned upwards and
                investigated the surface world from which their ancestors came,
                particularly deep gnome illusionists who hoped to find advanced
                instruction in the Art beyond what could be obtained in their
                isolated homes. Others become prospectors, searching the
                Underdark for new veins of gems and ore to mine.

                Adulthood was less defined among deep gnomes than among their

                handling the day in and day out bureaucracy. Significantly, the
                king and queen were rarely married to each another, but instead

                the death of their predecessor. Regardless of gender, there was

                Deep gnome culture was largely defined by the environment in
                which they lived. Deep gnome settlements were usually centered
                in a single large cavern, surrounded by an interlocking set of
                tunnels and other caverns into which the city spread.

                many inhabitants never ventured out of their havens, instead
                crowding together for protection. Population density was
                extremely high as most families shared a single, small room for
                their living space, with children living with their parents
                until they themselves married and had children.

                of their habitat. Their skill in mining, gem-cutting, and
                artificing made their handiwork well sought after by neutral

                They were also excellent guides, scouts and foragers because

                forgotten by the other races. Having to rely on stealth and
                cunning, they had truly mastered traveling through their

                Deep gnomes rarely wandered far beyond their hidden cities, but
                when they did, it was usually as bold prospectors, youthful
                illusionists, or exploring warriors. These bold souls shared a
                deep curiosity that allowed them to overcome their hard-bred
                caution and shyness, although other motives such as economic
                drive or a desire to seek aid to fight a threat the deep gnomes

                off steam. Deep gnomes' intense dedication and ability to

                activities.

                Deep gnome architecture, for instance, was shaped largely by the
                conditions they lived in, with the oldest homes often carved
                directly out of the surrounding rock. The highest-ranking
                members of any one clan usually inhabited large stalagmites
                while the lower-class lodged in the surrounding cavern floors or
                walls.

                Deep gnome cuisine was also a reflection of their livelihood,
                with the common staples made up of a variety of exotic fungi
                found only in the Underdark. Other common foods included blind
                fish and occasionally a roast made of rothé, goat, or mutton.
                Because fire produced unwanted light and smoke, deep gnomes
                generally preferred to salt their food instead of cook it, which
                made most svirfneblin food practically inedible to outsiders.

              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
                For drink, most deep gnomes drank a salty spirit, fermented
                fish, which, like svirfneblin food, was an acquired taste. On
                occasion, deep gnomes might drink a more potent beverage called
                Gogondy, said to contained powdered ruby and grant powerful
                visions to those who drank it.

                Artistically, deep gnomes preferred to use lots of gemstones,
                which were relatively common in svirfneblin communities, mined
                out of the veins along which their cities were built. Deep
                gnomes were some of the best jewelers in the Underdark.

                Deep gnomes also turned their cultivation of mushrooms for food
                into a wider industry, developing fungi not only for food but
                for textiles and wood as well. For their defense, deep gnomes
                most often designed weapons that could be used as non-violent
                tools as well, largely favoring the use of light picks, darts,
                or crossbows. Deep gnomes also used specialized weapons, such as

                    Undercommon. The svirfneblin dialect is more guttural than
                    surface Gnomish, and most svirfneblin know only a little bit
                    of Common, but those who deal with outsiders (and that
                    includes you as an adventurer) pick up enough Common to get
                    by in other lands.
