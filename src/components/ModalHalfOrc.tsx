                Half-orcs, colloquially known as half-tusks in Purskul and
                Zehoarastria of Amn, were humanoids born of both human and orc
                ancestry by a multitude of means. Having the combined physical
                power of their orcish ancestors with the agility of their human
                ones, half-orcs were formidable individuals. Though they were
                often shunned in both human and orcish society for different
                reasons, half-orcs have proven themselves from time to time as
                worthy heroes and dangerous villains. Their existence implied an
                interesting back story that most would not like to dwell on.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
                Half-orcs were typically between 5 feet 9 inches to 6 feet 4
                inches in height and weighed around 155 to 225 pounds. This made
                them slightly taller and stronger than the average human. Their
                skin often had a grayish hue, accompanied by jutting jaws,
                prominent teeth, a sloping forehead, and coarse body hair.
                Compared to full-blooded orcs, their canines were smaller, but
                they still appeared bestial to humans. In orcish societies, they
                were seen as having a more human-like appearance. Half-orc hair
                was primarily black and grayed swiftly as they aged.
                Lifespan-wise, they matured by sixteen and usually did not live
                past sixty years.

                Those raised among orcs might adopt the orcish tradition of
                ritual scarring. These scars weren't seen as blemishes or marks
                of shame but as symbols of pride, courage, and battle prowess.
                However, some half-orcs were forcibly scarred by orcs in a
                manner akin to cattle branding. Generally, half-orcs had shorter
                lifespans than humans, maturing earlier and rarely living beyond
                seventy-five years.

                Half-orcs, being a mix of human and orc lineage, displayed a
                combination of both races' traits. They were action-driven,
                persistent, and adaptable like humans. Their ability to thrive
                in unwelcoming environments was crucial, as they were often
                regarded as outsiders. However, from their orcish heritage, they
                inherited some less appreciated qualities, leading many to
                perceive them as uncivilized or impulsive. Their short tempers
                and straightforward approach sometimes made them seem brash, but
                in many situations, such a demeanor was invaluable.

                Generally, half-orcs were seen as moody and sullen, but they

                joys like feasting, singing, and dancing over refined
                activities. Many half-orcs upheld the free spirit of orcs, but
                with fewer malevolent inclinations. Raised among humans, they
                could be as noble as they were wicked. A common misconception
                was that half-orcs lacked intelligence, though this wasn't a
                universal trait.

                Half-orcs were known for their remarkable strength, comparable
                to orcs but with the added agility uncommon in many humanoids.
                They might not be as resilient as full orcs, but they were
                notably more nimble. A unique trait was their ability to rally
                when gravely wounded, almost as if the injuries invigorated
                them. Additionally, half-orcs could harness their raw emotion
                into formidable attacks. However, these abilities had their
                limits, and as battles dragged on, they could tire and become
                vulnerable like any other being.

              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
                Their agility was evident when they were enraged, allowing them
                to move swiftly. Some half-orcs had an inherent conflict between
                their dual heritages, turning this inner turmoil into sheer
                power. Others developed an insatiable appetite for battle,
                making them more resilient and deadly in combat.

                an orcish kingdom whose borders were laid along several human
                nations. Most half-orcs grew up amongst either humans or orcs,
                either in urban environments or—more often—along the outskirts
                of civilization, taking on many of the qualities of their home
