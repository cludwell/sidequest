                Tieflings were human-based planetouched, native outsiders that
                were infused with the touch of the fiendish planes, most often
                through descent from fiends—demons, Yugoloths, devils, evil
                deities, and others who had bred with humans. Tieflings were
                known for their cunning and personal allure, which made them
                excellent deceivers as well as inspiring leaders when prejudices
                were laid aside.
              </p>

              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
                Although their evil ancestors could be many generations removed,
                the taint lingered. Unlike half-fiends, tieflings were not
                predisposed to evil alignments and varied in alignment nearly as
                widely as full humans, though tieflings were certainly devious.
                The celestial counterparts of tieflings were called aasimar.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
                Tieflings tended to have an unsettling air about them, and most
                people were uncomfortable around them, whether they were aware
                of the tiefling's unsavory ancestry or not. While some looked
                like normal humans, most retained physical characteristics
                derived from their ancestor, with the most common such features
                being horns, prehensile or non-prehensile tails, and pointed
                teeth. Some tieflings also had eyes that were solid orbs of
                black, red, white, silver, or gold, while others had eyes more
                similar to those of humans. Other, more unusual characteristics
                included a sulfurous odor, cloven feet, or a general aura of
                discomfort they left on others.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
                In many other ways, tieflings were similar to humans physically.
                Tieflings were, on average, just as tall as humans, from 5 feet
                and 6 inches to 6 feet and 2 inches and weighed just a little
                bit heavier at 140 to 220 pounds. Tiefling skin was usually
                human-like in color, though extending past normal human colors
                into reddish hues as well. Tiefling hair was also often the same
                color as human hair, though dark blue, red, or purple were
                common shades amongst the race. Although it was not always the
                case, tieflings tended to have better reflexes than their human
                kin. This, along with their natural propensity for hiding and
                deceit, helped to give tieflings a reputation for thievery and
                duplicity.

              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
                Tieflings who had strikingly inhuman features were often killed
                at birth by their horrified parents or others. Only those
                tieflings with subtle features or born to someone indifferent to
                their appearance, either out of acceptance or cruel purpose,
                were likely to reach adulthood. Those tieflings who did reach
                adulthood could be expected to age at roughly the same rate.
                They had life spans roughly 20 to 40 years longer than normal
                humans.

                The physical appearance of a tiefling often depended on the
                exact ancestry that spawned it, a bloodline that might have
                remained dormant for generations. Diabolic or demonic tieflings
                could, besides the common horns and tails, possess a forked
                tongue, leathery or scaly skin, the smell of brimstone, or
                unusually warm flesh. Some accounts even held these tieflings to
                cast neither shadows nor reflections. Some diabolic tieflings
                also sported goat-like legs or hooves. Tieflings descended from
                rakshasa might have furred skin or feline eyes. Most tieflings
                had only one or two of these features.

              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
                Some tieflings were not descended from mere fiends at all, but
                from powerful gods. These tieflings often had their own physical
                characteristics that set them apart. Tieflings sired by Beshaba,
                for instance, often had antlers instead of horns and pale, white
                hair. Those sired by Mask, on the other hand, were known for
                their tendency to cast no reflection.

                In Mulhorand, the most common tieflings were often those spawned
                from a union with Set or Sebek. Most tieflings were, however,
                the grandchildren or even great-grandchildren of fiends and in
                Mulhorand's neighbor, Thay, most tieflings were spawned
                deliberately by powerful wizards as part of some elaborate plot
                for power.

              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
                In 1358 DR, a warlock coven known as the Toril thirteen
                performed a ritual that cursed most tiefling lineages—those of
                demons, devils, hags, and rakshasas, among others—with the
                "blood of Asmodeus", changing their original lineage with that
                of the archdevil himself. This was done to make Asmodeus a
                "racial god", ensuring him enough followers to attain godly
                powers. After the Spellplague of 1385 DR, when Asmodeus became a
                god, the magic of the ritual took effect across all of Toril and
                afterwards most tieflings living in the 15th century DR were of
                the Asmodean lineage, all having a similar devilish appearance.

              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
                Prior to Asmodeus's ascension to godhood, the infernal blood
                could be diluted through intermarriage, but afterward, the union
                of a tiefling with another race always produced a tiefling
                child.

                still the most numerous by a wide margin at the time.

                Tieflings, in general, didn't get along well with the other
                races of the world and were slow to trust others of any race,
                even their own. This animosity that tieflings had for others was
                taken to its extreme in the case of aasimar, whom tieflings
                instinctively feared or loathed. Devas often had a similar
                reaction, making it difficult for members of either race to
                successfully interact with each other. Of all the common races,
                tieflings felt the most kinship with half-orcs, who were
                similarly a target of revulsion and hate.{" "}

                Those tieflings who were religious were a varied lot, since no
                god held more sway over tieflings than any other, though
                Asmodeus, as the lord over the fiendish race of devils, may come
                close. Most tieflings called on one of the primary gods of their
                homeland, though there were exceptions. Beshaba, the goddess of
                bad luck, for instance, appealed to many of the race, owing to
                tieflings' collective sense of misfortune. Many evil tieflings
                who channeled their dark emotions into aggression often found
                themselves in the service of Cyric, as well. Prior to the
                Spellplague and the god's subsequent disappearance, Gargauth
                also drew a large number of worshipers seeking vengeance, as did
                Mask, who gathered tiefling thieves to his church. Shar, like
                Gargauth, appealed to those with a taste for vengeance.
