            Side Quest is a portfolio project I started because I noticed there
            was huge potential in AI for this specific task and to best showcase
            my capabilities as a Full Stack Developer. Language models allow a
            level of flexibility difficult to match in a video game.
            Experimenting with Chat GPT I realized that tons of fan content must
            have been fed into the model as it was frightenly good at what it
            did.
          </p>
          <p className="py-6">
            SideQuest was made with Next.js, next-auth, DaisyUI, Prisma, and
            TypeScript. I will be continually updating and working on this
            project as character creation in DnD is no small task.
