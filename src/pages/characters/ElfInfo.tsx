                As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least
                the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two
                kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and
                valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the
                sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive,
                believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other
                elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk, the
                Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten
                Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered
                among humans and other races.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The sun elves of Faerûn (also called gold elves or sunrise
                elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden
                blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also
                called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with
                alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair
                of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond,
                brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green
                and flecked with gold.

              elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerûn, wood elves

            are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under
            5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans,
            weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the

            Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant

          <p>
            Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective
            on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply.
            They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be
            curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty
            happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on
            a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and
            relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even
            slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and
            to serious insults with vengeance.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of
            danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve
            differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known
            to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that
            they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises,
            elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword,
            bow, and strategy.

            Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees.
            Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill
            and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for
            clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting
            finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders
            is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading
            crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).

            Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so
            long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery.
            They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day
            to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers
            that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy
            exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power,
            and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels
            fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of
            moral causes.

              Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply,
              remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. While meditating, you
              can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental
              exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.
              After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human
              does from 8 hours of sleep.

              rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other
              races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish
              ballads to their repertoires.
