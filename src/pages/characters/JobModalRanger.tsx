                By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the
                magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.
                See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the
                Spells Listing for the ranger spell list.

              <h3 className="font-xl my-4 underline">Spell Slots</h3>
              <p>
                The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast
                your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
                spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.
                You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship
                and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you
                can cast animal friendship using either slot.
              </p>
              <br />

              <h3 className="font-xl my-4 underline">
                Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
              </h3>
              <p>
                You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger
                spell list.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn
                more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be
                of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when
                you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell
                of 1st or 2nd level.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can
                choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with
                another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of
                a level for which you have spell slots.
              </p>
              <br />

              <h3 className="font-xl my-4 underline">Spellcasting Ability</h3>
              <p>
                Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells,
                since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use
                your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
                ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting
                the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making
                an attack roll with one.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom

                At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your
                enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom
                modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you
                make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use
                this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of
                the roll are applied.
