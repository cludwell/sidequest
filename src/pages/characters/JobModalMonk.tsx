                At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of
                combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which
                are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the

                  You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and
                  damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
                </li>
                <li className="my-2">
                  You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your
                  unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain
                  monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk

                  When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a
                  monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a
                  bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and
                  attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed
                  strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a

                <li className="my-2">
                  Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons.
                  For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood
                  connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle
                  with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever
                  name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game
                  statistics provided for the weapon in the Weapons section.

                Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the
                mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented
                by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number

                When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a
                short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your
                expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30

                Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving
                throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is
