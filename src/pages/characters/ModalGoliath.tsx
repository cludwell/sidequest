                half-orcs. Goliaths had noticeably bony or prominent

                bright blue or green and sometimes glowed a little.

                Goliath skin was often gray or brown and was extremely tough
                (often compared to stone). One of the most distinctive features
                of the goliath was the darker (often vertically symmetrical)
                patches of skin that covered their entire bodies. Goliaths
                believed that these markings somehow explained or controlled
                their fate or destiny. For this reason, goliaths never tattooed
                themselves as this could affect their future.

                Goliaths' most notable characteristic was their competitiveness.
                They kept track of their accomplishments and saw everything as a
                challenge. Those not familiar with goliath psychology would
                often get annoyed when goliaths constantly reminded them how
                many times a certain thing had happened, thinking them arrogant
                or self-centered. This was not the case however. To goliaths,
                score-keeping was a natural and integral part of life, not meant
                to belittle or demean anyone.

                But a goliath's most fierce competitor was themselves. Beating
                their own records was the most satisfying victory for a goliath.
                They were also competitive with their companions and other
                goliaths, but were never arrogant or cocky. Goliaths had little
                time for cheaters, gloaters, and sore losers. Goliaths never
                held grudges if they lost a fair fight, and would often repeat
                the goliath maxim that "Today's rival is tomorrow's teammate."

                Goliath tribes only went to war as a final option, preferring to
                move away from unsafe lands. They did not do this out of fear or
                cowardice, instead they were aware that loss of life in their
                tribe was undesirable and had long-term consequences. If forced
                to go to war, however, a tribe would do so without fear.
                Circumstances that might force a tribe included being cornered
                or having members of their tribe kidnapped.

                Once weapons were distributed and war-captains were chosen, a
                goliath tribe could quickly become a very capable war-band.
                Goliaths were always at the peak of their physical condition and
                their fine-tuned hunting skills made them competent warriors at
                a moment's notice. All adult goliaths (regardless of sex) fought
                in times of war. Only children and infants were expected not to
                fight.

              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
                Hide and leather armor were favored by goliaths as they already
                had naturally durable bodies and did not like to restrict their
                movement. Goliaths often used large two-handed weapons to make
                the most of their considerable strength. Goliaths often employed
                guerrilla tactics in battle, owing to their upbringing as
                hunters.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
                Fair-play was also integral to goliath fights. As long as they
                were fairly sure they could still win, goliaths would even
                handicap themselves to give their opponents a fair chance. For
                example, if a goliath disarmed their opponent, they would throw
                aside their own weapon and continue the fight with their fists.
                As with their recreational sports, goliaths seriously frowned
                upon "cheating" in battle. Finishing off a fallen foe, taking
                hostages, and attacking civilians were considered distasteful
                and unfair.

                Goliaths lived in small tribes that numbered between forty and
                sixty goliaths. This was usually made up of three to five
                extended families. Most goliaths lived in the same tribe their
                entire life. On rare occasions, a tribe that got too large would
                split into smaller tribes or smaller tribes would merge
                together.

                Goliath tribes had a number of key roles that were filled by the
                most capable members. These roles included Chieftain, Captain,
                Skywatcher, Dawncaller, Adjudicator, Tent-mother, and Lamentor.
                The Chieftain was the primary authority figure in a tribe and
                had the responsibility of making major decisions. The Captains
                were responsible for assigning daily tasks. Skywatchers, often
                druids or shamans, ensured that resources were not overused.
                Dawncallers guarded the camp overnight. Adjudicators settled
                disputes. Tent-mothers took care of the infants and toddlers.
                Lamentors determined when an elder member was no longer able to
                contribute to the tribe.

              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
                Tribe chieftains only maintained power as long as they could
                prove they were suitable for that role. As a result, leadership
                constantly changed. New leaders were chosen by contests. Any
                goliath could challenge the chieftain to replace them.
                Leadership challenges consisted of three tasks, and the
                challenger had to win all three to become the new chieftain. The
                old chieftain would then leave the tribe permanently. The
                tribes' reliance on innate wisdom in their leaders meant that
                they valued wisdom gained from natural ability over that from
                years of experience.

              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
                The competitive nature of goliaths meant that the attitude and
                achievements of one would quickly inspire the whole tribe.
                Individuals within tribes would constantly be trying to outdo
                each other's good deeds, leading nearby settlements to often
                stereotype goliaths as a heroic and good people.

                a goliath, the person who is best at a job should be the one

                A goliath’s nickname is a description that can change on the

                deed, either a success or failure, committed by the goliath.
                Goliaths assign and use nicknames with their friends of other
                races, and change them to refer to an individual’s notable
                deeds.
