                sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von
                Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect
                the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or
                desecrated, as with the hallow spell.

              <p>
                By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through
                meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See
                Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the
                Spells Listing for the paladin spell list.

                Preparing and Casting Spells
              </h3>
              <p>
                The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast
                your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st
                level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or
                higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a
                long rest. You prepare the list of paladin spells that are
                available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list.
                The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four
                1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. If you prepare the
                1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level
                or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from
                your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of
                prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new
                list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and
                meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on
                your list.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl my-4 underline">Spellcasting Ability</h3>
              <p>
                Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells,
                since their power derives from the strength of your convictions.
                You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your
                spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma
                modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell
                you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
                modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your
                Charisma modifier
              </p>
              <br />

              <h3 className="text-xl my-4 underline">Spellcasting Focus</h3>
              <p>
                You can use a holy symbol (see the Adventuring Gear section) as
                a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.

                Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee

              <h3 className="text-xl my-4 underline">Oath Spells</h3>
              <p>
                Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to
                these spells at the levels specified in the oath description.
                Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it
                prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells
                you can prepare each day.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin
                spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3 className="text-xl my-4 underline">Channel Divinity</h3>
              <p>
                Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical
                effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath
                explains how to use it.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to
                use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your
                Channel Divinity again.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you
                use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin
                spell save DC.
