            The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place
            to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and
            clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and
            fine conversation.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural
            communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured
            by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new
            lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food,
            hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along a dirt
            road or a raft floating downriver.

            The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures
            by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing
            about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have
            managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the
            edges of wars and political strife. They are inclined to be stout,
            weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Halflings' skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their
            hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or
            hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are
            rare among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear
            simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They're
            concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use
            for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their
            treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see.
            They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a
            problem, and have little patience for dithering.

            Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds
            of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home,
            harboring few dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among them
            usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship,
            wanderlust, or curiosity. They love discovering new things, even
            simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of
            clothing.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing
            suffer. They are generous, happily sharing what they have even in
            lean times.

            Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of humans, dwarves,
            or elves, making themselves valuable and welcome. The combination of
            their inherent stealth and their unassuming nature helps halflings
            to avoid unwanted attention.

          <br />
          <p>
            Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their
            friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable
            ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are
            threatened.

            Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with large farms
            and well-kept groves. They rarely build kingdoms of their own or
            even hold much land beyond their quiet shires. They typically don't
            recognize any sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking
            to family elders to guide them. Families preserve their traditional
            ways despite the rise and fall of empires.

          <br />
          <p>
            Many halflings live among other races, where the halflings' hard
            work and loyal outlook offer them abundant rewards and creature
            comforts. Some halfling communities travel as a way of life, driving
            wagons or guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no
            permanent home.
