10/15
-
-create dice buttons, useState, and send to chat

10/16
-put socials in about page
-perfect prompt
-

TO DO MVP
<!-- -create user sign up feature -->
-make sure that dungeonmaster loads with prompt
-magic casters have spells on creation
-natural explorer for rangers

TO DO POLISH
-reuse char sheet modal and make a scene modal to put in header when selected
-will want to make sure that selected character and scenes clear on log out
-Creating update route for characters will have to empty objects on form selections so that spells, languages, etc do not persist
-include text prompts that trigger leveling up or conditionally render exit from dungeon master page ---this could mean automating some sort of leveling up functionality
-perfect prompt to model so that there are some guardrails (example: char should have spells or skills that are erroneously missing from char sheet)

Nit Picks
-if first user message to language model is short, the chat bubble is centered and not aligned to the right


-CRUD for created characters
-hopefully set up AWS for uploading CHARACTER images at a future date
-try to see if you can redirect to next portion of character form on selection

Lessons learned

Daisy UI is a great library but some of the components, the Drawer (Sidebar), are incompatible as opacity and z-indices prevent the expected layering behavior. Despite being based on tailwinds, some components lack customizability.

ChatGPT doesnt offer state. A huge drawback to practical uses of an ai API in your app. Imagine an ai customer service rep, having to send all your policies with every request would be expensive. Disappointing as a paid service that this drawback exists.

Redux Toolkit and Next.js
Getting these technologies to work together was pretty challenging as there isnt much documentation out there about using them together. A lot of trial, error, and luck to happen upon the right resources was required to get these two working together.

TypeScript
Used it purely to build my skillset and make myself more marketable as a candidate. A good excercise but would not use otherwise. Benefits of horizontal Next.js file structure are mitigated by clutter of files exporting type definitions.
